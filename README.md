# My first Nvim config

I have been watching Primeagen for a long time and have been impressed with his
CLI skills and have always wanted to try using a CLI focused IDE. I have always
found it a little bit difficult to work and edit files in nvim because I was 
so very well comfy with the crazy VS Code environment and plugins that it comes
with, but lately I see a new colleague of mine also using Neovim to do his work
which made me extra wanting to use it and Today is the day I finally give up 
this feeling that I had in my mind and decided to go full on to try to set a env
for myself and try to use Nvim at some scale and increase my dependability on it
as I could.

This readme is just so that I can document that story. My colleagues name is
Duarte, I don't know if he will ever see this but if he does, that I was motivated 
a bit by you. 

Thanks Primeagen, Lets begin our new journey with Neovim
